Grading
=======

1. Does the program compile and run with no errors or warnings?

2. Does the program meet all of the assignments requirements? If the assignment calls for certain output, number of method calls, test plan, calculations, random numbers, dialog boxes, etc., make sure that the program meets all of these requirements.

3. Has a Word doc or docx file containing a screenshot of the program compilation and execution and a test plan plus a .java file of the source code been submitted? 

4. Have sufficient comment lines been inserted into the program? Comment lines indicating program author, date, assignment, and program description, as well as descriptions of program lines/sections should be inserted. The sections of any program are input, calculations, and output.

5. Have blocks of code been indented to make the program easy to read and understand? The outermost (not indented) lines should be lines such as package..., import..., and class declaration. The second level is main(). The third level is any line under main that does not begin a block of code, such as a loop. The fourth level of indentation is any line within a block. Up to 7 or 8 levels are possible.

6. Does the program meet the highest level of quality described in the assignment and project rubric?

7. Have you submitted a doc or docx file with a screenshot showing the successful compilation and esecution of your program? Have you submitted a .java file with the source code of your program?

8. When required, has a comprehensive test plan been included in the docx file, along with a summary of results and a screenshot of at least one case?
