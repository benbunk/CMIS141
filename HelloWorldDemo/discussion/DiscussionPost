I had the week off so I decided this would be a great opportunity to try out some of the more advanced tools for building Java programs that I've been meaning to try including Maven, JUnit, CheckStyle, FindBugs, and JavaDoc.

I used Maven to build my template instead of NetBeans and then went through and added my own code through Sublime Text.

To make a functioning JUnit test it required adding a new method.

Here is the JUnit Test.

I think this commenting style clearly indicates which method applies to which section (input/conditions/output) but please let me know if I should do it differently?

Finally, Maven packages all of my code in a JAR file so I had to include the class path and the entire package declaration to run the program.
	java -cp target/HelloWorldDemo-1.0-DEV.jar edu.umuc.cmis141.helloworlddemo.App



The cool thing about Maven is it spits out a complete website for each project that can be automatically uploaded to github complete with all the reports from JavaDoc, CheckStyle, FindBugs, and Maven itself. Here are links to everything:
