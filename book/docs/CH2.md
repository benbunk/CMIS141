Section 2.2
===

An algorithm determines how a problem is solved by listing the actions that need to be taken and their order.

Symbols represent variables in a program. A variable represents a value stored in memory.
	
For instance:
```java
int x = 1;
```

Data types let the compiler know what the symbol (variable) represent.

  Some PRIMITIVE data types include:
  1. Int
  2. Float
  3. Double
  4. Long
  5. String
  6. byte
